**ChainScore**

Decentralized Review, Reputation & Reward Economy Powered by Linera

**🧠 Why ChainScore?**

Today, the internet is full of untrustworthy reviews:

❌ Fake ratings posted by bots
❌ Brands deleting legitimate criticism
❌ Influencers manipulating opinions
❌ Reviewers get nothing for contributing
❌ No proof that a reviewer actually used the product
❌ Centralized platforms control reputation (Google, Yelp, Amazon)

This leads to broken trust between brands and consumers.

**✅ The ChainScore Solution**

ChainScore creates a trust-first review ecosystem where:

✔ Reviews are verified on-chain, not controlled by corporations
✔ Consumers earn real rewards for honest contributions
✔ Brands prove authenticity with transparent reputation
✔ Credibility is algorithmic — not manipulated
✔ Every business has its own microchain for scalable trust data

🔗 Powered by Linera microchains, ChainScore turns reputation into a public good — decentralized, fair, and incentivized.

**🌟 Vision**

To make trust measurable, ownership fair, and reputation unstoppable.
ChainScore is building the world’s first trust economy — where truth pays.
